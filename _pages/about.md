I'm a speech scientist, a linguist, a researcher, and an educator. I currently work as a PhD Candidate in the Communicative Sciences and Disorders department at New York University. In any capacity, I believe that our voice is critical to our sense of self, and misalignment of how we sound and who we believe ourselves to be can drastically impact our quality of life.

<strong>My research</strong> focuses on the acoustic and social dimensions of pathologized and non-pathologized voice qualities using acoustic analysis, perception experiments, and automatic detection methods. For the past several years, I've been thinking and writing about vocal fry. 

<strong>My teaching</strong> experience includes introductory linguistics, (acoustic) phonetics, culturally responsive practices, and English as a new language. In my teaching philosophy, I regard the student as a knowledge-holder and encourage curiousity.

I currently work with [Dr. Susannah V. Levi](https://wp.nyu.edu/levi/) in the [Acoustic Phonetics and Perception Lab](https://wp.nyu.edu/appl/) and [Dr. Aaron M. Johnson](https://www.voicescientist.com/) at [NYU Langoneâ€™s Voice and Swallowing Center](https://nyulangone.org/care-services/voice-center?cid=sem_google&sem_campaign_id=22139905662&sem_ad_group_id=&sem_creative_id=&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=22716220022&gbraid=0AAAAAC9qk2tWTmFTVtXetNoNXKP4QpeV3&gclid=Cj0KCQjwhafEBhCcARIsAEGZEKJ7QbzHtxACQuBHZcp0e7Bxcy-2hEIAcj2NorNVm1JPbXTdytL-WPEaAjcAEALw_wcB).
