I am a PhD Candidate in the Communicative Sciences and Disorders department at New York University. I work with Dr. Susannah V. Levi in the Acoustic Phonetics and Perception Lab and with Dr. Aaron M. Johnson at NYU Langoneâ€™s Voice and Swallowing Center. My research focuses on the acoustic and social dimensions of pathologized and non-pathologized voice qualities using acoustic analysis, perception experiments, and automatic detection methods.
