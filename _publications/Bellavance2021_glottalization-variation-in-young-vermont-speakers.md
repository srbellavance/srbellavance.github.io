excerpt: 'Glottalization of /t/ has been found in an array of British English varieties (Trudgill 1974) and among a few American English varieties (Roberts 2006, Eddington and Taylor 2009, Farrington 2018). This paper expands on previous findings of /t/ glottalization in Vermont English, particularly in young speakers, by providing evidence of phonetic variation of a stigmatized variant.'
